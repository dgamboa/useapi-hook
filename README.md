# useApi Custom React Hook

## Overview
The useApi custom hook allows the app to set variables that depend on API calls:
1. by setting the hook in one line and passing in a predefined API function
1. while retaining control on when the call gets made
1. and without having to write asynchronous code

This streamlines the development process by allowing the team to focus on building their respective components without having to worry about API responses and promises, error handling, or nuances in API call implementations.
